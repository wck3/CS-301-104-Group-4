# Weather Insight: Providing accurate weather prediction solutions to improve your bottom line 
## Juan Lopez, William Kaminski, Pedro Pacheco

Weather Insight is a weather prediction company providing the best weather data and predictions in the industry. One of our main goals is to tackle the problem of increasing the accuracy of hourly rainfall predictions using polarimetric radar measurements. Rainfall is crucial in agriculture, as it is important to know how much rain fell in a particular field. Predicting it accurately is paramount because it is impossible to measure rainfall precisely in every particular location. The results can be useful as an input for hydrological and agronomic models. We will use radar data collected hourly from midwestern corn-growing states for 20 days between April and August 2014, obtained from the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/how-much-did-it-rain-ii/.).

As an introductory background reading we have the aforementioned Kaggle competition page and an [article on weather radar polarimetry](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.4011/full/). We will employ regression methods on the provided dataset and will use Mean Absolute Error as an evaluation metric. We will plot these results for comparison to show the accuracy of our weather prediction systems. 

With these models, we aim to improve the quality of agriculture, along with providing information that can benefit both farmers and society. The lack of precipitation caused half a decade of drought in the Dust Bowl, and our data, prediction and metrics can help continue to prevent such a crippling famine. Water Insight will not only help farmers, but society as a whole. With our calculations, together, we can create a better agricultural outcome in order to better society as a whole. Are you ready to revolutionize agriculture with us?
